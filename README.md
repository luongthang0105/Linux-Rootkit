# Setup
- A C compiler to run Makefile
- Run this code on a Virtual Machine, as we will be modifying how kernel works (a bit!). I use VirtualBox VM with Vagrant to do all this.


# Instructions to run
`sudo insmod rootkit.c` - to install our defined kernel module into the kernel

... to be continued with other useful commands
